Hi! I'm Tom Machin -- among many things I am a student engineer at **Monash University**, where I study mechatronics engineering.<p>
I'm the current **lead pilot** at Monash Uncrewed Aerial Systems (MUAS), a student team dedicated to developing new and creative drone technology for humanitarian purposes.<p>
Outside of uni, I'm always working on two or three other projects, ranging from designing custom RC aircraft and other **aerospace** models, to **electrical** and **software** projects.<p>
This blog serves as a way for me to write about and reflect on my experiences in all these areas of my life, whilst also documenting my projects for anyone interested (or at least stuck with the same problem I'm facing...)<p>
Come along, say hi, and never leave your LiPo's on charge overnight &#x1F525;&#x1F62D;
