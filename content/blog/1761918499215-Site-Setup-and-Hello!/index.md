Howdy Viewer!<p>
Well, I need to set up a "first" message for this site and I can't always be bothered to be creative so here it is.<p>
Welcome to the blog! This serves a mixture between a professional portfolio, a space for design reviews and updates and an art blog.<p>
At the end of the day I'm not (that) delusional, I understand that this site will mostly be seen by friends, family, and hiring managers' assistants (to whom I wish to say: please please please please I'll do anything for this job please), and not so much by the general public or even many other hobbyists. <p>
But hey, maybe -- just maybe -- this site is more about me having a spot to express my projects openly, and to accomodate whichever five people find me interesting enough to read through my ramblings.<p>
**[Current Projects]**<p>
The Mach1-N Homemade Rudder Pedals<br>
Stickbug Ultralight RC Flyer<br>
Chinook Bicopter RC Multirotor<br>
Scorpion Quad Rebuild<br>
A whole lot of flight training on the Top-Hobby Riot V2 Trainer<p>
