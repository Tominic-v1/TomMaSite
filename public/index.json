With this solution, the objective is to eliminate this dependency and create a completely all-in-one gimbal package, including manual control of the gimbal\u0026rsquo;s attitude via a ground operator, and automatic visual tracking of a sister device.\nThis device is to be built on top of an existing gimbal/gimbal-controller pair and is only designed for high-level control of the gimbal\u0026rsquo;s attitude. The creation of a new gimbal and gimbal controller, capable of IMU measurements and camera stabilisation, falls outside the scope of this project.\nWith this complete solution, one should be able to place nearly any gimbal/gimbal-controller pair and this device onto any drone (given an adequate MTOW), and capture clear, high-quality footage without significant camera operation experience.\nThe addition of automatic tracking via the inclusion of spatial positioning technologies could potentially eliminate the need for a dedicated camera operator. By gathering the position of both the gimbal-side device and sister device, the gimbal can be told to point in the direction of the sister device at all times, allowing for automated object tracking without human intervention.\nBackground\r#\rWhile flying my RC plane at my local airfield recently, I had to imagine what the view from a camera drone tracking my plane would be. The problem was that I didn\u0026rsquo;t currently have any drones capable of supporting and controlling a gimbal, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a hand free to control the camera regardless.\nI figured that a simple, AIO retrofit gimbal controller would be the only solution, one that included automatic object tracking via a sister device on the video\u0026rsquo;s subject.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen a fair share of drone flights, both at MUAS and in my own time. Other obstacles I knew I needed to overcome included the difficulty of tracking objects using only low-quality FPV feeds, especially when the object was in a noisy environment, concealed by foliage, or in front of the sun. These issues served to further push me towards the solution I had been imagining.\nAI-powered object tracking, whilst significantly more robust than it used to be, still has limitations when there are multiple aircraft flying in a single airspace, and struggle if the subject is concealed by foliage or is in front of the sun.\nvia u/akotski1338\nProblem Analysis\r#\rObjective\r#\rTo create a solution capable of attaching to existing drones without changes to that drone\u0026rsquo;s architecture, which allows guided manual and automatic gimbal control, eliminating the need for a highly skilled camera operator to capture high-quality aerial footage. The need for a drone pilot cannot yet be (legally) eliminated, the need for a camera operator should be completely eliminated by the device\u0026rsquo;s autonomous mode.\nFunctions\r#\rPrimary Functions\nControl gimbal attitude Automatically track its sister device Allow manual gimbal control via the sister device Secondary Functions\nIdentify the device\u0026rsquo;s spatial position relative to its sister device Communicate wirelessly via long-range radio signal Be powered by a completely independent power system and battery Restrictions\r#\rFinancial\r#\rThe initial solution may take several iterations to develop and will be built on student-level experience in microcontroller programming. As such it\u0026rsquo;s important to consider the importance of reducing development costs in the earliest stages of product development, as large investments may prove unnecessary with additional learnings.\nExperience\r#\rAs mentioned under the Objective heading above, this solution must be designed to be usable without significant training or explanation. Its design, including its housing\u0026rsquo;s form factor and status indicators, must be self-explanatory to the untrained eye.\nPerformance\r#\rFor gimbal control, measurements and calculations will need to be rapid and clean. The selected microcontroller and peripherals must be capable of high-speed communication and acquisition of subjects in order for the recording quality to be a significant increase from the average user.\nTo Be Continued\u0026hellip;\r#\r","date":"13 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/AIO-Gimbal-Controller/","section":"Projects","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Specialized Solution for Automatic Object Tracking and Remote Gimbal Control with an All-in-One Package.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\r\n\u003ch1 class=\"relative group\"\u003eAbstract\r\n    \u003cdiv id=\"abstract\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n    \r\n    \u003cspan\r\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none\"\u003e\r\n        \u003ca class=\"text-primary-300 dark:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#abstract\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\r\n    \u003c/span\u003e\r\n    \r\n\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eTraditional camera-drone solutions are designed to function within the existing drone\u0026rsquo;s avionics ecosystem, requiring for changes to the drone\u0026rsquo;s design and architecture to implement.

The two control modes I\u0026rsquo;m looking for are: manual control via a thumbstick, and automatic tracking via a secondary device on a subject.\nInitial Prototype\r#\rJustifications\r#\rMy initial design decisions have largely been informed by one factor: cost. I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen components that are cheap, simple, or recovered from tech I already have. Even in spite of this, the current setup cost has already exceeded $100AUD, and so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend getting into a project similar to this unless you have a decent understanding of microcontroller tech and can avoid the pitfalls I fell into.\nWhy STM32?\r#\rFor my microcontroller, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to go with a Nucleo32 MCU. My justification for this decision are two-fold:\nit has far better CPU, clock speed, RAM and firmware size than similarly sized Arduinos such as the Arduino Nano, (and since this project needs to be able to fit into a user\u0026rsquo;s pocket MCU size matters) and;\nI\u0026rsquo;m familiar with them and already had several laying around. RE: the second justification, given that I\u0026rsquo;m receiving no financial help with this project and am developing it on my own time, money and passion, I see every cent saved as invaluable. One of the many things I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt during development of my prototype has been that whilst it\u0026rsquo;s possible to spend hours speccing a component to within your project requirements, sometimes simplicity and money win out. In the interest of shortening my R\u0026amp;D time and saving money by avoiding purchasing respecced components, cheap beats optimal every time.\nHAL coding is still painful, and made no easier by STM32CubeIDE\u0026rsquo;s cantankerous attitude to basic requests, but I always find that limitations in projects like this only make development more chaotic and fun. STM32 may not be as foolproof as Arduino but through developing my initial prototype I\u0026rsquo;ve found that a neat side effect of having to code from the ground up is that I\u0026rsquo;ve gained a top-to-bottom understanding of my implementation.\nWhy that power supply?\r#\rLooking at my solution you may have noticed a particularly ugly power regulator unit. This is, as I\u0026rsquo;m sure many hobbyists could recognise, the power regulator meant to fit on an Arduino board, with pin spacing specifically for the dupont pins on Uno-/Zero-form-factor boards. Why use a massive power regulator that still only provides 600mA output and has features that are completely unnecessary for this project?\nI\u0026rsquo;m familair with them and already had several laying around.\nAgain, familiarity means less time doubting the regulator\u0026rsquo;s quality; already having several available means no down-time waiting for components to arrive; redundant feature means less chance of having to respecc later on should my requirements change. Of course, if I was designing for a commerical product likely to be used outside of my film projects or MUAS\u0026rsquo; flight days, I would eventually move from these R\u0026amp;D-grade components to better specced, more specialised components, in order to bring both cost and size down.\nWhy the rest of those components?\r#\rFor all other components, they\u0026rsquo;re easy enough to justify:\nMy thumbstick is a simple 2-potentiometer gaming controller thumbstick. Whilst this is technically less reliable and lower resolution than hall-effect-based thumbsticks, it makes more sense given my space restrictions and the filtering that\u0026rsquo;s already going to be applied to manual camera control inputs.\nMy barometer, magnetometer and GPS are all \u0026ldquo;Arduino-friendly\u0026rdquo; components built to be interfaced with breadboards and Arduinos. These offer great performance without me having to spend precious development time designing my own sensor logic. So far, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty blown away by the resolution of each of these components given that their total cost is less than $35AUD\nMy radios are pairs of 915MHz 3DR SiK Radios. When it comes to UART communications, these are incredibly simple, compact, and designed for drone use, making them especially resilient to damage and ESC-frequency-range interference.\nWhere to now?\r#\rThe next step will be to implement true data fusion between my GPS, barometer and magnetometer to create a high-quality picture of the drone\u0026rsquo;s true position, both relative to the Earth and the sister device. With this I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to get automatic camera tracking running and put those telemetry sensors to use, since I get the sense they\u0026rsquo;re starting to feel left out.\n","date":"31 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/1761918499215-site-setup-and-hello/","section":"Blogs","summary":"The First Devlog for my AIO Gimbal Controller.
