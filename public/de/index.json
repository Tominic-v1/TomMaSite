With this solution, the objective is to eliminate this dependency and create a completely all-in-one gimbal package, including manual control of the gimbal\u0026rsquo;s attitude via a ground operator, and automatic visual tracking of a sister device.\nThis device is to be built on top of an existing gimbal/gimbal-controller pair, and is only designed for high-level control of the gimbal\u0026rsquo;s attitude. The creation of a new gimbal and gimbal controller, capable of IMU measurements and camera stabilisation, falls outside the scope of this project.\nWith this complete solution, one should be able to place nearly any gimbal/gimbal-controller pair and this device onto any drone (given an adequate MTOW), and capture clear, high quality footage without significant camera operation experience.\nThe addition of automatic tracking via the inclusion of spatial positioning technologies could potentially eliminate the need for a dedicated camera operator. By gathering the position of both the gimbal-side device and sister device, the gimbal can be told to point in the direction of the sister device at all times, allowing for automated object tracking without human intervention.\nBackground\r#\rAs lead pilot for Monash Uncrewed Aerial Systems (MUAS), I have seen many experimental drone flights in my time. One obstacle in gathering high quality footage of these flights is the difficulty in identifying and tracking these small flying objects from a drone at a safe distance; live video feeds rarely make manual object acquisition easy, especially in environments with lots of noise, multipathing or visual distractions. The addition of automated object tracking to this solution gives it a leg up over similar solutions, which rarely offer such features. AI-powered object tracking, whilst significantly more robust than it used to be, still has limitations when there are multiple aircraft flying in a single airspace, and struggle if the subject is concealed by foliage or is in front of the sun.\nvia u/akotski1338\nProblem Analysis\r#\rObjective\r#\rTo eliminate the need for a skilled camera operator to gather high-quality aerial footage from a multirotor; current solutions rely on manual controls from a skilled camera operator as well as a drone pilot. Whilst the need for a drone pilot cannot yet be (legally) eliminated, the ideal conclusion of this solution would be a device that completely eliminates the need for a camera operator.\nFunctions\r#\rPrimary Functions\nControl gimbal attitude Automatically track its sister device Allow manual gimbal control via the sister device Secondary Functions\nIdentify the device\u0026rsquo;s spatial position relative to its sister device Communicate wirelessly via long-range radio signal Be powered by a completely independent power system and battery Restrictions\r#\rFinancial\r#\rThe initial solution may take several iterations to develop, and will be built on student-level experience in microcontroller programming. As such it\u0026rsquo;s important to consider the importance of reducing development costs in the earliest stages of product development, as large investments may prove unnecessary with additional learnings.\nExperience\r#\rAs mentioned under the Objective heading above, this solution must be designed to be usable without significant training or explanation. Its design, including its housing\u0026rsquo;s form factor and status indicators, must be self-explanatory to the untrained eye.\nPerformance\r#\rFor gimbal control, measurements and calculations will need to be rapid and clean. The selected microcontroller and peripherals must be capable of high-speed communication and acquisition of subjects in order for the recording quality to be a significant increase from the average user.\nTo Be Continued\u0026hellip;\r#\r","date":"13 Januar 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/AIO-Gimbal-Controller/","section":"Projects","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Specialized Solution for Automatic Object Tracking and Remote Gimbal Control with an All-in-One Package.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\r\n\u003ch1 class=\"relative group\"\u003eAbstract\r\n    \u003cdiv id=\"abstract\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n    \r\n    \u003cspan\r\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none\"\u003e\r\n        \u003ca class=\"text-primary-300 dark:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#abstract\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\r\n    \u003c/span\u003e\r\n    \r\n\u003c/h1\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eTraditional camera-drone solutions are designed to function within the existing drone\u0026rsquo;s avionics ecosystem, requiring for changes to the drone\u0026rsquo;s design and architecture to implement.
